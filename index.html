	    	<p>During the summer of my sophmore year, the summer of 2015, I had the pleasure of interning at Core BTS Incorporated.</p>
	      	<p>While I was interning with Core BTS I was able to gain some valuable insight into the nature of working in the technology industry. Many of my day-to-day tasks included troubleshooting and maintaining iPads and computer systems at various Long Island public high schools, as well as working closely with full-time Core BTS engineers to design and implement networks at the schools.</p>

			<h3>Cisco Certification Course</h3>
		    <p>During my high school academic career I was given the oppurtunity to take a Cisco CCNA Certification course.</p>
		    <p>This Cisco course was a major reason as to why I choose to study Computer Science. During the duration of this two year course, I was able to learn the basics of network design and network implementation. Throughout the course I was able to work closely with Cisco networking equipment, both through simulations and physical hardware. The courses prepared me to create computer networks, troubleshoot computer networks, as well as the basis of network administration.</p>

	      <p>I am currently a member of the Boston College Computer Science Society, a prevelant technology club at Boston College.</p>
	      <p>Boston College Computer Science Society is responsible for a great deal of activities on the Boston College campus. These various events include planning development workshops for students who are new to computer science, as well as though just wish to advance their skills, holiding networking nights for students studying in the computer science field, and having various technology companies come and speak to students regarding the work environment in the technology industry. During the fall semester of the 2015/2016, we were lucky enough to have a series of talks on cybersecurity from a representative at IBM.</p>

	    	<p>I am currently involved in the mentoring program Big Brothers Big Sisters, or as it is called on our campus, "BC Bigs".</p>
	      	<p>BC Bigs has had maor impact on my experience here at Boston College. I joined the program at the beginning of my junior year and since then it has been an incredible experience. Since joining the program, I have been able to become a mentor and role model for a fantastic young man named Damond, as well as open a new perspective on my own life. I cannot say enough positive things about the program and how it has impacted my life since I began volunteering in it!</p>
