                  <p class="text-muted">My name is Maxwell Oldshein and I am a recent graduate of Boston College, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Economics. I am currently searching for an entry-level software engineering position in the technology field. As of December 2017, I am working as a Data Center Technical Analyst at Citi Group in New York, New York. While I have interacted with quite a few programming languages during my studies and my personal projects, my strongest languages are Java, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I am constantly working to improve my programming skills and remain very active on many coding websites, such as Codecademy, HackerRank, CodeWars, and Coursera in order to sharpen my skills. Some of my interests include learning new web development technologies and expanding my mobile application development skills for both Android and iOS.</p>

As a teaching assistant for this course, I was responsible for assisting the professor in instructing two sections of approximately 40 students each. In addition to this, I was responsible for grading the students' assignments and holding office hours for the students on a weekly basis. The office hours served as an opportunity for me to assist the students in learning SQL, either through questions on course material or homework assignments.</p>

As an IT Security Intern, I had many tasks, many of which pertained to the assurance of the protection of Protected Health Information and Payment Card Information. In addition to these, I was responsible for working very closely with a project manager to roll out a proof of concept for an AirWatch mobile device management solution that the department was testing. My involvement in this project included hands-on testing of devices to see if the software met our standard of compliance. In addition to the testing, I also collected direct feedback from employees who were running the software on their devices regularly. I was also responsible for researching, installing, and testing a new case management tool on a Linux server for the department. In addition to these tasks, I was responsbile for detonating malware to test its effectiveness and capabilities on our system through a dedicated machine known as a "scrub box."</p>
