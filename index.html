		    		<h3>Northwell Health</h3>
		    		<p>After completing my junior year, in the summer of 2016, I had the unique opportunity of interning at Northwell Health.</p>
		      		<p>While interning at Northwell Health, I gained valuable insight into the nature of work in the technology sector of healthcare, with a major empahsis on cyber security. I was tasked with assisting in the assurance of protection of Patient Healthcare Information and Payment Card Information compliance. I was also responsible for independently testing and deploying a Case Management tool, Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR) on a Linux-based server. In addition, I was also responsible for testing and deploying a Proof of Concept for Northwell's rollout of VMWare's AirWatch Mobile Device Management tool.</p>

		    	<h3>Core BTS</h3>
		    	<p>After completing my sophomore year, in the summer of 2015, I had the unique opportunity of interning at Core BTS.</p>
		      	<p>While interning at Core, I gained valuable insight into the nature of work in the technology industry. Many of my day-to-day tasks included troubleshooting and maintaining iPads and computer systems at various Long Island public high schools, as well as working closely with full-time Core BTS engineers to design and implement networks at the schools.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="col-sm-3">
				<h3>Cisco Certification Course</h3>
			    <p>During high school, in conjunction with SUNY Farmingdale State College, I was given the opportunity to take a 2 year Cisco CCNA Certification Course.</p>
			    <p>As a result of this course, my interest in the Computer Science field was sparked.  During this 2 year course I learned the basics of network design and network implementation. Throughout the course I was able to work closely with Cisco networking equipment, both through simulation and actual hardware. The course gave me instruction in creating computer networks, troubleshooting networks and a basic understanding of network administration.</p>

		    <div class="col-sm-3">
		      <h3>Boston College Computer Science Society</h3>
		      <p>I am currently a member of the Boston College Computer Science Society, an active technology club on campus.</p>
		      <p>BC Computer Science Society is responsible for many campus activities such as developmental workshops for students new to the Computer Science field and for students wishing to advance their skills, networking nights for students, and sponsoring technology companies to speak with students concerning the work environment in the industry. During the fall semester 2015 we were fortunate to have a series of talks on Cybersecurity from an IBM representative.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="col-sm-3">
		      <h3>Big Brothers Big Sisters</h3>
		      <p>I am currently involved in the mentoring program Big Brothers Big Sisters, or as it is called on our campus, "BC Bigs".</p>
		      <p>BC Bigs has had a major impact on my experience here at Boston College.  I first joined the program at the start of my junior year and it has been an incredibly fulfilling experience.  Since joining the program, I have been able to be a true mentor and role model to an amazing 12 year old boy who might not have been given such an opportunity.  Working with him has given him new prospective on his life and he has done the same for me.  I cannot begin to expound on all the positive aspects of this program, but merely say it has been life changing for me and enriched my experience here at Boston College.</p>
